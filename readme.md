##Work Area for practicing KNN

This is my repo for practicing, learning and demonstrating concepts with Classification using the K nearest neighbors algorithm. I will likely use some of this content to create blog posts (if I come up with something interesting) to share what I've learnt. I also intend to try things out in multiple languages starting with Python and R.
